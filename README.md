# Samourai Dojo with Rust Electrum Server

Fork of [Samourai Dojo](https://github.com/Samourai-Wallet/samourai-dojo) with added support for [electrs](https://github.com/romanz/electrs/blob/master/doc/usage.md) - romanz' light weight implementation of Electrum Server in Rust.


## Installation ##

### MyDojo (installation with Docker and Docker Compose)

For installation of Samourai Dojo, view [Dojo's documentation](./doc/DOCKER_setup.md) 


### Electrs

Before starting dojo server, build the eclectrs docker image

Clone the repository and build the docker image

```sh
git clone https://github.com/romanz/electrs.git
cd electrs
docker build -t electrs-app .
```

*TODO*: Modify `dojo.sh` install scripts to add the building of electrs image

### Adding electrs to existing dojo installation

If you are adding electrs to existing dojo installation, you need to fully remove the tor container, its storage and image (because the `/etc/tor/torrc` is added in docker image):

```sh
docker container rm tor
docker volume rm my-dojo_data-tor
docker image ls   # get the tor image id of samouraiwallet/dojo-tor
docker image rm <imageid>   # image id of samouraiwallet/dojo-tor
```

After that you can run `./dojo.sh start` and the tor's image will be rebuilt


## Electrum wallet (client) ##

Prerequisites:  
* Configure the tor proxy on your computer (google how to install this on your computer)
* \<onion address> generated by dojo's tor (check by `dojo.sh onion`)


### Start from command line

The safest is to start electrum server from command line to make sure that when you startup the wallet it does not connect to random servers:

```sh
electrum --oneserver --server <your-onion-address>.onion:50001:t --proxy socks5:127.0.0.1:<tor proxy port>
```

### Edit electrum config file 

Alternatively, edit `~/.electrum/config` and change the following parameters (which has the same effect as the above command line):
```
"oneserver": true,
"proxy": "socks5:127.0.0.1:9060::",
"server": "<onion address>.onion:50001:t",
```
